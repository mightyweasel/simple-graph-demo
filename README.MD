# simple-graph-demo

Graph databases are interesting, but unless you are heavily into tech it can be hard to see why.
The Neo4J Browser provides a very good visualizer once you understand Cypher.
While explaining Neo4J it can be intimidating to people when they see Cypher / code.

This page aims to show (and help explain) why graphs are interesting, without having to
write or see any Cypher queries, unlike the built in Neo4J Browser!

We will leverage:

    -neoVis.js for the data visualization
    
    -materialize.css for the web page components
